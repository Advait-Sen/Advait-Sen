# Advait-Sen 
I am a student at the British School of Milan.
I am also a budding comedian and computer scientist, and poet (not that any of my poetry is available online).

My dream job is to work at Mojang, though I would also be happy to work at the forefront of Computer Science
research in the world (yes I have my priorities straight).

## Languages
I speak English, Italian, Hindi, Bengali, French and a bit of Spanish. I'mma add translated versions in as many
languages as possible Soon(tm).
